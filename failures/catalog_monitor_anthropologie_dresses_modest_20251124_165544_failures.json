  "notes": "This was an earlier catalog monitoring attempt for Anthropologie dresses. The extraction validation detected that too few products were being returned (46 vs expected 50+), with DOM finding 72 URLs. This suggests Gemini was filtering out or failing to process a significant number of products. Enhanced failure tracking was not yet deployed during this run.",
